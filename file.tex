OAKLAND -- "Life is a race: If you're not fast enough, you'll get trampled," booms engineering college dean Viru Sahastrabudhhe (Boman Irani). The stakes are high: in India 2.0, students whose parents have sacrificed everything for their education are expected to reach the top. But three brainy misfits -- Farhan (R. Madhavan), Raju (Sharman Joshi) and Rancho (Aamir Khan) -- find a common bond when they realize that their futures aren't exactly inscribed in a mathematics book.

As Rancho, a young engineer of dazzling inventiveness, Khan conveys smarts, mischief and, finally, compassion, as he spurs his friends on to greatness before he mysteriously disappears.
